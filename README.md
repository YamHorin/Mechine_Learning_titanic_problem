The Titanic's tragic demise on April 15, 1912, during its inaugural voyage stands as an enduring symbol of maritime disaster. Despite its reputation as an "unsinkable" vessel, the RMS Titanic succumbed to the frigid waters of the North Atlantic after striking an iceberg. Tragically, the insufficient number of lifeboats led to the loss of 1502 souls among the 2224 passengers and crew aboard.

Amidst this catastrophe, patterns emerge regarding who had a better chance of survival. In this endeavor, I've embarked on a quest to unravel the factors influencing survival rates. Leveraging passenger data encompassing variables like name, age, gender, and socio-economic class, I've constructed a predictive model. This model aims to discern the characteristics that correlated with higher odds of survival.

Throughout this undertaking, I've conducted a series of experiments, exploring various models and data subdivisions. The objective is clear: identify the model boasting the highest accuracy and the lowest cross-entropy loss. Through meticulous analysis and iteration, I endeavor to shed light on the intricate dynamics that governed survival aboard the ill-fated Titanic.
